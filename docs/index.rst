Overview
--------

Vector is a Python 3.8+ library (Python 3.6 and 3.7 supported till ``v0.9.0`` and ``v1.0.0``, respectively) for 2D, 3D, and `Lorentz vectors <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity#Physics_in_spacetime>`_, especially *arrays of vectors*, to solve common physics problems in a NumPy-like way.

Main features of Vector:

* Pure Python with NumPy as its only dependency. This makes it easier to install.
* Vectors may be represented in a variety of coordinate systems: Cartesian, cylindrical, pseudorapidity, and any combination of these with time or proper time for Lorentz vectors. In all, there are 12 coordinate systems: {*x* - *y* vs *œÅ* - *œÜ* in the azimuthal plane} √ó {*z* vs *Œ∏* vs *Œ∑* longitudinally} √ó {*t* vs *œÑ* temporally}.
* Uses names and conventions set by `ROOT <https://root.cern/>`_'s `TLorentzVector <https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTLorentzVector.html>`_ and `Math::LorentzVector <https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classROOT_1_1Math_1_1LorentzVector.html>`_, as well as `scikit-hep/math <https://github.com/scikit-hep/scikit-hep/tree/master/skhep/math>`_, `uproot-methods TLorentzVector <https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot3-methods/blob/master/uproot3_methods/classes/TLorentzVector.py>`_, `henryiii/hepvector <https://github.com/henryiii/hepvector>`_, and `coffea.nanoevents.methods.vector <https://coffeateam.github.io/coffea/modules/coffea.nanoevents.methods.vector.html>`_.
* Implemented on a variety of backends:
   * pure Python objects
   * NumPy arrays of vectors (as a `structured array <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.rec.html>`_ subclass)
   * `Awkward Arrays <https://awkward-array.org/>`_ of vectors
   * potential for more: CuPy, TensorFlow, Torch, JAX...
* NumPy/Awkward backends also implemented in `Numba <https://numba.pydata.org/>`_ for JIT-compiled calculations on vectors.
* Distinction between geometrical vectors, which have a minimum of attribute and method names, and vectors representing momentum, which have synonyms like ``pt`` = ``rho``, ``energy`` = ``t``, ``mass`` = ``tau``.

Installation
------------
Vector is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/vector/>`_ as well as on `conda <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/vector>`_. The library can be installed using ``pip`` -

.. code-block::

   pip install vector

or using ``conda`` -

.. code-block::

   conda install -c conda-forge vector

Example gallery
---------------
``Vector`` has several examples covering the basics as well as some advanced usage of the library. The example gallery
covers almost all the features offered by ``vector`` and any new additions to the gallery are welcomed.

**Note**: Adding more examples and improving the existing examples for newcomers is still in progress.
