Vector comes loaded with 3 + 2 backends; a pure Python object backend, a NumPy backend, an Awkward
Array backend, an Object-Numba, and an Awkward-Numba backend to leverage JIT (Just In Time) compiled
calculations on vectors. Other potential future vanilla backends include Tensorflow and JAX, and
other possible future Numba-backends include Numba-NumPy.
